# Research Notes

*Supplementary research log for SP-CellBots — explorations, prototypes, dead ends, and conceptual branches that extend beyond the core implementation.*

This section documents the *explorative side* of the project:  
algorithms, experiments, observations, or early tests that are **not** (yet) part of the official CellBots implementation — but which may be useful for:

- future extensions  
- other developers  
- researchers in modular robotics  
- perpendicular fields (programmable matter, swarm robotics, GPU simulation, morphic algorithms)

The goal is to maintain a **map of the research landscape** surrounding CellBots:  
including early ideas, abandoned paths, performance tests, alternative topologies, and conceptual side-notes that provide context and inspiration beyond the current codebase.
