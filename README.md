# SP-CellBots – A Simulator for Programmable Matter

**SP-CellBots** is an open simulation and control system for programmable matter.  
It is based on a fictional hardware model: the **SP-CellBot**, a modular unit capable of moving across identical elements, stacking, and forming fixed connections in order to *morph* into arbitrary 
structures.

## 🧩 Version

Current version: **1.4**  
Developed and tested on **Node.js v23.11.0**.  
Due to rapid ecosystem changes, newer or older versions may cause incompatibilities.

Latest changes:

- **1.4** (11.12.2025)  
**Stability & Compatibility Update for Node.js v23.11.0**
  - Updated entire codebase for compatibility with **Node.js v23.11.0**
  - Fixed **RSA signing** (stable PKCS8 flow) and added **PEM compression / restore helpers**
  - Centralized signature logic in **`/common/signature/`**
  - Resolved ED25519 Base64 encoding/decoding inconsistencies
  - Added **`system_utils.js`** with automatic Node.js version validation
  - Introduced **MasterBot auto-connect / reconnect** mechanism
  - Cleanly decoupled WebGUI websocket (`ws_gui`) from ClusterSim TCP client
  - Reworked shutdown handling — no more double termination of processes
  - Internal refactoring for long-term extensibility  
    (multiple MasterBots, persistent hardware targets, async pipeline)

## 🚧 Planned Features

- **Decentralized AntMorph algorithm (planned):**  
  A lightweight, swarm-based morphing system is in development, inspired by ant behavior.  
  Bots will attempt to fill free target positions without global coordination, based on local visibility and optional heuristics (e.g., cluster center proximity).  
  Goal: support fast and distributed formation of arbitrary patterns in constrained environments.
